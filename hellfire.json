    "description": "Considered monstrous for it\\'s large amount of weapons slots at the time, the Hellfire was the hull of choice for farming and PvP combat. Became even more widely used with the introduction of Nova rays and the Infernal Weapons.",
    "obtaining": "Can be obtained in the Demon Corps campaign mission. Mk ups found in lv 60+ Vsec as well as Battleship supply runs.",
    "tips-builds": "Hellfire Battleships proved to have a variety to weapon choices. Nova rays were seen as a requirement for farming Aliens as well as adequate in PvP combat. Infernal Vector torpedos with NET torpedos were another commonly used combo for both PvP combat, though proved unreliable against alien targets. Infernal Wave drivers was also a favorite in PvP and farming, though again despised for long refit times as well as also being unreliable against alien targets. Armored Thrusters 3 was seen as a requirement above Fusion Thrusters 3 for giving the extra speed needed in PvP combat and farming.",
