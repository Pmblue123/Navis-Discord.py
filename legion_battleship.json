    "description": "The Legion Battleship is a ship with no practical uses. It is outshadowed by the Hellfire battleship for it\\'s lack of mobility and specials. The ship can equip squadrons, but can be easily sniped by just about anything in FvF combat. It is at best a collector\\'s item.",
    "obtaining": "The ship is only obtainable in the demon corps campaign mission. Mk ups for the ship no longer exist in-game.",
    "tips-builds": "Dont build this ship, I\\'m saving you precious time and resources...",
