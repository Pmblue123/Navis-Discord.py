    "description": "The Valrayvn, also known as the Val, is a Ranger class ship that has tha ability to dodge incoming projectiles and then it goes \"pew pew\" in your face and your ship dies in like 2 seconds.",
    "obtaining": "In order to get this hull, you can farm Onyx targets in order to get the blueprints for its weapons and armor along with the hull itself. I recommend getting the blueprint using event points then building Vals with Nova Missiles (not Nova Driver) in order to farm for the rest of the blueprints. ",
    "tips-builds": "Get this hull as soon as possible, since it is great for farming and fighting. ",
