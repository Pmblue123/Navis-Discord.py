    "description": "This ship is extremely fast, going 900 forward, w/ 680 strafe. Whenever it takes 1250 damage to shield, it gains double strafe and forward speed, 100% shield defense, and increased damage for 4 seconds. This is the fastest ship in the game, although it is limited to a max range of 3000m. It specializes at killing Pharmakon w/ boosts to Screen damage and Phase Hacking. Vectors beware. Shields recharge 5% energy a second w/ no delay and can recharge after full depletion.",
    "obtaining": "You can obtain it in the HIJACK event.",
    "tips-builds": "- This ship is very effective against all Pharmakon targets with its built-in Phase Charge Hacking and Screen Damage. This means this ship functions well with conventional damage types as it doesn't need the extra boost AL damage provides.\n- Due to the massive 5% shield recharge per second, heavily loading this ship with shields is very advisable.\n- Thanks to the high recharge and +10% shield defense during overdrive, the Orion can survive on it's own without needing support from an Ajax.",
