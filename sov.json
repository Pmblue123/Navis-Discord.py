    "description": "This carrier is not like other carriers, it has the ability to have multiple beam weapons that can deal a good amount of damage, and can be used for farming if piloted correctly. So basically it goes \\\"IMMA FIRING MA LAZERRR\\\" then other ship dies slowly and painfully.",
    "obtaining": "In order to get this ship, you can either gain it through events, such as Altairian Strike, or from attacking the Mothership cargo fleets.",
    "tips-builds": "Basically just keep on adding cyclotron beams to your sov, but you also want some armor and some thrusters as well.",
