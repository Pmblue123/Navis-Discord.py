    "description": "A long range artillery Umbra ship. Its Gorgon Gaze can instantly disrupt enemy walls to create openings for itself and other ships in the fleet to cause massive damage.",
    "obtaining": "You can get the Medusa in T7 strikes or by hitting the Umbra Hunter(92) fleets in umbra deep space.",
    "tips-builds": "Possessing increased module damage, like its Altairian counterpart the Inquisitor Destroyer, the Medusa is designed to bombard slow moving or stationary targets from afar, out of range of most other ship weapons. Its Altairian Damage modifier also makes it well suited to taking on Altairian Fleets as well.",
