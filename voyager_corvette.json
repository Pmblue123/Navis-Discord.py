    "tips-builds": "Voyager Corvettes are incredibly cheap to produce and commonly used as a spam ship.\nObviously, this ship is a direct upgrade from the Pathfinder Corvette, but it does not have a large impact considering that you only have 1 Pathfinder Corvette but can build up to 100 Voyager Corvettes (or any other ship, for that matter).",
