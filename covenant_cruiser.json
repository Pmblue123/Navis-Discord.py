    "description": "The Covenant Cruiser at the time of release was seen as the best combat cruiser there was. With 5 weapon slots, it overshadowed the heretic for less repair time and more damage dealt. It was desired in both farming and PvP.",
    "obtaining": "Can be recieved in the Demon Corp campaign mission. Mk ups found in lv 60+ Vsec and Cruiser supply runs.",
    "tips-builds": "Typically used with Reverb rays, Infernal Gatling rays, or Manifold missiles (personal recommendation) as the weapon of choice. Manifolds used with the Blister Rounds special on the cruiser proved best for farming and in FvF/FvB combat.",
